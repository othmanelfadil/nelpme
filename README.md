# A first step towards NLP
This snippet is POC of the extraction of relevant information (*dates*,*places*...) from an etymology description for our etymology dataset mainly to test how the LLM handles the NLP task thus to apply it to our entire dataset.


## this is the result on the first word of our dataset!

### Issues?
well i might be trippin but sometimes running the same script the LLM returns null on all fields expect the date one i have no idea what causes this (*hallucination*,*bad prompt*,*rate limiting*....)
